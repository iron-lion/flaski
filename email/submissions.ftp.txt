Hi {{ user.firstname }}

your request "{{ filename }}" for {{ submission_type }} analysis has been received.

Please transfer your data over FTP to 

ftp:  {{ PUREFTPD_MYSQL_SERVER }}
user: {{ ftp_user }}
pass: {{ ftp_pass }}

drop all your files on the main folder, do not create subdirectories. 

Example with ncftp:
```
# navigate to your raw data folder
cd ~/myrawdata
# login with ncftp
ncftp -u {{ ftp_user }} -p {{ ftp_pass }} {{ PUREFTPD_MYSQL_SERVER }}
# upload your raw files
mput *.fastq.gz
# upload your md5sums file
put md5sums.txt
``` 

Instructions on how to use cyberduck for transfering your data can be found here: https://github.com/mpg-age-bioinformatics/flaski/blob/main/ftp_info/README.md 

Please realise that this FTP account will be inactivated in 2 weeks.

Once you've transfered all your files click on the following link to start the analysis:

If you only have SRA data you do not need to download/upload it yourself, just go ahead and click the link above.

Cheers!

Flaski
